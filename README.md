How to Play
The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 appears on the board.

Use arrow keys (or swipe gestures on mobile) to move the tiles in different directions.
Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge to become a single tile with the number 4.
After every move, a new tile with the number 2 randomly appears on an empty spot on the board.
The game ends when there are no empty spots on the board and no adjacent tiles with the same number can be merged.
